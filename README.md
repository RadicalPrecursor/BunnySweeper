# BunnySweeper

I got an itch to play Minesweeper and figured instead of trying to find an inoffensive app it would be most straightforward to just hack my own.

So behold, nobody had to install Windows 95!  And the flavor text/framing is about a bunch of cute sleeping bunnies because that's much better for those of us with excessively-active imaginations.

## Technical

App made in React with Vite.  Fire up your own version with `npm run dev` if you like.

This is my first Vite app, now that `create-react-app` is not really being supported anymore.

## Philosophical

As a kid I remember the ways an office full of computers just seemed like toys.  I could amuse myself exploring and watching the different screensavers, and with that exhausted there were always two actual games: Solitaire and Minesweeper.

Solitaire made sense to me: a card game (really a set of card games), cards are a normal way to play games, and here it was just rendered on the screen for me in a format that taught and enforced the rules.

Minesweeper seemed conjured directly from its own alien Computer Space, a sea of tiles and a smiley face and a weird serifed number 1 you used to mark the bad tiles.  A game of pure abstraction that needed no phyiscal inspiration.

It is good when children do not understand what landmines are, or the reasons that adults will deliberately place them in the world.
